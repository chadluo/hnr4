## What is this?

Yet another Hacker News Reader with metadata cards and some summaries by `text-davinci-003` (hint: the italic monospace
text).

The prompt is far from good and some summaries are strangely off topic. Don't trust them.

## Why 4?

Internal version. 2 & 3 never got finished but started with different architecture and frameworks so must be separated.

## Nice.

Thanks.

## Bad.

Yeah.
